This project was proposed by the L-TOUR.IPT, the Tourism Laboratory of the Polytechnic Institute of Tomar. The general objective of the project was to value the cultural heritage touristically by creating a Model (MovTour Model) replicable in other regions.

I collaborated with the project as a supervisor (co-supervised with Professor Luís
Oliveira) of 2 master’s theses from students of the Master in Informatics Engineering at the same institution (<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10400.26/28595" target="_blank">Pedro Nunes</a> and <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10400.26/28603" target="_blank">Miguel Coelho</a>). The work consisted in development of a complete tourism platform (mobile app, backend and Bluetooth beacons) to manage monuments and points of interest. The system was particularly interesting by allowing users to be informed automatically about interesting points nearby (via Bluetooth beacon detection), while providing data analytics to the tourist operator (real time, historic and future predictions). A working prototype was installed at the Convent of Christ, Tomar.
