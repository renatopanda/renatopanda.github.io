The initial idea was proposed by <a href="https://github.com/bettercallcruz" target="_blank">Pedro Cruz</a>, a BSc student which practices Enduro motorcycle sport â€“ create a simple system to detect falls during his Enduro trips and message his emergency contact.

Although being a bachelor degree project, it started earlier (in September 2019) and exposed the student to a myriad of different concepts:
* Hardware / device creation (3D printed box, ESP32, MPU6050, battery)
* Real-time operating systems programming (FreeRTOS) with parallel tasks accross the available cores
* Mobile app development (React Native Android app that controls the hardware and reads sensors data via Bluetooth)
* Backend development (using Node.JS and MongoDB)
* Introduction to pattern recognition (data analysis, simple decision trees, possibility of exploring simple machine learning concepts)

The year long project was divided in several mini-projects, from hardware testing, selection and design. Developing the freeRTOS code, Android App, collecting some example datasets, API+frontend and data analysis.

The HW part was one of the major challenges, testing different prototypes and even printing a 3D case.

Although unfinished, the last part consisted in analysing data from trips and simulated crashes.
