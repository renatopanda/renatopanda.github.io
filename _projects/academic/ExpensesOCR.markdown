The problem was introduced by an external company as a challenge (Softinsa/IBM) and independently supervised by me at IPT and developed by <a href="https://github.com/helderfoca" target="_blank">HÃ©lder Lopes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aluno19987" target="_blank">Edgar Oliveira</a>: a solution to improve how collaborators report travel expenses. The students developed an Android application (prototype), which uses optical characters recognition and machine learning, to scan invoices (e.g., meal, gas, train) and recognize the type and expense, introducing it in the system.

To this end, the students were tested several different solutions, settling with Android native development, OpenCV for OCR and MonkeyLearn to the the text classification into one of the possible categories.
