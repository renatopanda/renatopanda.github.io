The Fraunhofer Portugal Challenge is an idea contest promoted by Fraunhofer AICOS with the objective of motivating and rewarding research of practical utility, through the attribution of a scientific prize to MSc and PhD students and researchers from Portuguese Universities.

The challenge was open to any PhD and MSc students and was conducted over tree phases:
<ul>
    <li>1st phase: 6 slides and 500 chars abstract</li>
    <li>2nd phase: 2 pages abstract and short CV</li>
    <li>final event: 10 minutes presentation and 5 minutes discussion</li>
</ul>

Due to the global pandemic this year's event was organized via video conference. Still it was very instesting with Inês Machado winning the 1st prize (PhD - Sneaking into the brain with a new GPS-like technology).
